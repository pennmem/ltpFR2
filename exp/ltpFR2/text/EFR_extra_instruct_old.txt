It is not uncommon for words not presented on the most recent list to come to mind, or to think of words you have recalled correctly after you said them aloud. In this section of the study, we would like you to continue to recall words from the just-presented list. In addition, we would like you to recall, aloud, other words that come to mind. If a word you say was not on the just-presented list, or if you have already recalled the word, we would like you to press the SPACEBAR key after you have said the word but before recalling the next word.
