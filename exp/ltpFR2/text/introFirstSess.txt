Thank you for participating in this psychology study.  We are
interested in how people remember words while performing other tasks.

During the course of the study, words will appear on the computer screen, one at a time.  Focus on each word as it appears on the screen, and try not
to think back to previous words.

After viewing the words, you will be asked to recall all the words from that
list in any order.
