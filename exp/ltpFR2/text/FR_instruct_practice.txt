On some of the lists you will be making the same judgment on every
word, and on other lists you will be switching back and forth between
judgments.  These switching lists can be a bit challenging; try to
stay focused in order to make your responses quickly and accurately.

The first three lists are designed to give you practice on the
different tasks.  All the words in the first list will have the same
judgment.  All the words in the second list will have the other
judgment.  The third list will be a mix of both judgments.
