We will now review the basics of the study, and the experimenter
will answer any questions that you have.

1) Several words will come onscreen one at a time.

2) After the list, there will be a recall period in which you report
as many words from the list as possible.

3) Between lists, you will be given a timed "break" screen. This will count down from five seconds, but you may press the SPACE BAR to pause the countdown and take more time.

It is very important for you to try to avoid all unnecessary motion 
while engaged in the study, INCLUDING the recall period.  Please try to limit these activities 
to the time during the breaks.

Remember to avoid blinking when words are onscreen.

You are now ready to begin the study!

If you have any remaining questions, please ask the experimenter now.

Otherwise, press RETURN to continue.
