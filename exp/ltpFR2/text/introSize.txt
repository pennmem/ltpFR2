The size judgment

The size judgment involves deciding whether or not the word refers to
an object that could fit into a regular shoebox.

There are two possible choices for each word: "big" and "small".  

For example, if we asked you to judge the word "baseball", you would
press "small" because a baseball can certainly fit into a shoebox.

For some words, it won't be clear what the right answer is; just
answer according to your first reaction to the word.
