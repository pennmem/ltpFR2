Before some lists and some recall periods, you will be given the task of solving math problems in the form "A+B+C=", where A, B, and C are integers.

When you see a math problem, please type in the answer using the
keypad and then press the ENTER key.  You can use the BACKSPACE key if
you make a mistake.  

A counter at the top of the screen will keep track of how many math
problems you answered correctly.   

You will now have a chance to practice the math task.  Consider this
practice session as an opportunity to build up speed without
sacrificing accuracy. 

When you have finished reading these instructions, press RETURN to start the math practice.
