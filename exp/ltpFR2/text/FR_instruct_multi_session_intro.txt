Thank you, once again, for participating in this psychology study.  We are
interested in how people make simple judgments about common words.

During the course of the study, words will appear on the computer
screen.  You will be asked to make one of two judgments about each word.

It is very important for you to try to avoid all unnecessary motion,
especially eye blinks, while engaged in the experiment.  Please try to
limit these activities to the time during the breaks.

In the middle of the session there will also be a longer break to give
the experimenters some time to readjust the electrodes, and you a
chance to relax.

To remind you from our last session, the two judgments are:

1) A size judgment

2) A living/nonliving judgment

We will now review the basics of the experiment.
