For the remainder of the lists, you will be asked to make one of two judgments about each word by
pressing a key. You will have three seconds to make the judgment before the
next word comes up.

The two judgments are:

1) A size judgment

2) A living/nonliving judgment

After viewing the words, you will be asked to recall all the words from that
list in any order.

We will now go through some details about the judgments.
