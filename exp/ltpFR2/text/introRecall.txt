After the last word in each list and the math section 
that follows it, you will see a row of asterisks
(*******) flash on the screen and you will hear a tone.  

At this time, say as many words as you can remember from the list, IN
ANY ORDER.  Speak loudly and clearly.  You will have a fixed amount of
time in which to recall the list.  Please try hard throughout the
recall period, as you may recall some words even when you feel you
have exhausted your memory.
