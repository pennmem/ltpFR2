Thank you for participating in this psychology study.  We are
interested in how people make simple judgments about common words and
how they subsequently remember the words.

During the course of the study, words will appear on the computer
screen.  You will be asked to make one of two judgments about each
word by pressing a key.  You will have three seconds to make the 
judgment before the next word comes up.

The two judgments are:

1) A size judgment

2) A living/nonliving judgment

After making judgments about all the words in a list, you will be 
asked to recall all the words from that list in any order.  Over the
course of the session, you will study and recall 20 lists of words.

We will now go through some details about the judgments.
