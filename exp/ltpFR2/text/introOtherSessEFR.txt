Thank you, once again, for participating in this psychology study.  We are
interested in how people make simple judgments about common words and
how they subsequently remember the words.

During the course of the study, words will appear on the computer screen. On
some lists, you will be asked to make one of two judgments about each word by
pressing a key. You will have three seconds to make the judgment before the
next word comes up.

The three conditions are:

1) No judgment

2) A size judgment

3) A living/nonliving judgment

Sometimes, it won't be clear what the right answer is; just
answer according to your first reaction to the word.

In this section of the study, we would like you to vocalize words that come to mind more than in previous trials.

Please continue to recall words from the just-presented list.  In addition, every time a specific, concrete word comes to mind, say it aloud, even if you have already recalled it, or if it was not presented on the most recent list.

Try not to "think out loud" during recall.  That is, only say specific words that come to mind.

If the word you have just said aloud was NOT presented on the most recent list, or if you have already recalled it in this recall period, press the SPACE BAR key after recalling that word, but before recalling the next word.
