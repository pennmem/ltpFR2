The living/nonliving judgment

The living/nonliving judgment involves deciding whether or not a given
word refers to something that is alive.

There are two possible choices for each word: "living" and
"nonliving".

For example, if we asked you to judge the word "baseball", you would
press "nonliving" because a baseball is certainly not alive. 

Again, sometimes it won't be clear what the right answer is; just
answer according to your first reaction to the word.
