In this section of the study, we would like you to vocalize words that come to mind more than in previous trials.

Please continue to recall as many words as possible from the just-presented list.  In addition, every time a specific, salient word comes to mind, say it aloud, even if you have already recalled it or if it was not presented on the most recent list.

Only say other words if they come to mind as you are trying to recall items on the most recently presented list. This is not a free-association task.

If the word you have just said aloud was NOT presented on the most recent list, or if you have already recalled it in this recall period, press the SPACE BAR key after recalling that word, but before recalling the next word.

To help guide you, the experimenter will give you feedback after every recall period in this session. For this reason, at the end of each recall period, please wait for the experimenter's feedback before continuing with the next trial.
